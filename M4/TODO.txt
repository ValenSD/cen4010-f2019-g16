These are a few things that I found while putting together the script for the youtube video presentation of our website.

Format for list is: #.[page] Description

1.[Login & Register] Information for testing shows up.
2.[Login & Register] Need a banner to easily tell what the website is called.
3.[Register] Need to verify password entry to make sure user enters the password they intend.
4.[Post Snapshot] User is allowed to choose any date they like, is this meant to be a kind of feature or would it be better to have it automatically post the current days date?
5.[Post Snapshot] Reset button does not change the location of a picture if selected on the post snapshot page.
6.[Login & Register] No testing is being done to check if an email has already been registered and it is creating errors upon login.
7.[Main Page] Subject and Description entered in "Post Snapshot" are opposite what is entered.
