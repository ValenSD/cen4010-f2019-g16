id_posts is the id that you get from table POSTS. That's is why you need to first insert in POSTS, get the id_posts and use across the other tables;
idUSERS is the id that you get after inserting in the table USERS

the ids that we are using are the primary key of the tables that are autoincrement fields. 

For example, to insert a new post you need:

1. Insert int table POSTS. You already have the idUSERS, because when you do the login, we can get that value from the table USERS.
2. get the idPOSTS and save it in a php variable. This is the unique id of the post and will be used in the other tables. 
3. Insert the message that the user has posted in the table POSTMESSAGES.  You will need the idPOST from step 2. 
4. Insert the image information into the table POSTIMGPATH. Again you will need the idPOSTS FROM step 2. 

Now you have all the values from the user post in the database. 
To query the user post, you need the idUSERS. With it you do a query in POSTS looking for the idUSERS. From there you get the idPOSTS. With it, you can get the message and the path information of the uploaded image.
