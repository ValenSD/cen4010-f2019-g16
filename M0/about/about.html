          <!--About me-->I have been coding since I was 11 and haven't stopped since! I love computers and video games,
          I thought that I wanted to make that my career
          but as of lately I have had many doors open up to me that would allow me to work with my hands and not have to
          sit behind a desk all day.
          I have a passion for solving problems and want to do that everyday.</p>
